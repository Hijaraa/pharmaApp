# Pharmacy Application Testing Summary

## Overview

In response to the request to test the Pharmacy Application and provide commands for interacting with its pages and features, I have created the following:

1. **Test Scripts**: Scripts to automate testing of the application
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for using and testing the application
3. **Verification Tools**: Scripts to verify that the application can be built and run

## Files Created

### Test Scripts

1. **`test_pharmacy_app.bat`**
   - A comprehensive test script that builds the application, runs it with the H2 database, and tests all web pages and API endpoints by opening them in the browser.
   - This script provides an easy way to verify that all parts of the application are working correctly.

2. **`verify_build_and_run.bat`**
   - A simple script to verify that the application can be built and run successfully.
   - This is useful for quick verification without opening browser windows.

### Documentation

1. **`PHARMACY_APP_GUIDE.md`**
   - A comprehensive user guide that explains how to run the application, lists all web pages and REST API endpoints, and provides instructions for testing.
   - This guide serves as a reference for users who want to interact with the application.

2. **`README_TESTING.md`**
   - A testing guide that provides an overview of all the scripts and documentation, explains the testing approach, and lists all the pages and endpoints to test.
   - This guide helps users understand how to test the application effectively.

## Application Structure

The Pharmacy Application is a Spring Boot application with:

1. **Web Interface**: HTML pages for managing medications, products, sales, purchases, suppliers, and alerts.
2. **REST API**: Endpoints for programmatic access to the application's data and functionality.
3. **Database**: Support for both MySQL and H2 in-memory databases.

## Testing Approach

The testing approach includes:

1. **Manual Testing**: Using the test script to open all web pages and API endpoints in the browser.
2. **Automated Testing**: Running the existing unit tests using Maven.
3. **Build Verification**: Ensuring the application can be built and run successfully.

## How to Use

1. To test all functionality:
   ```
   test_pharmacy_app.bat
   ```

2. To verify the application can be built and run:
   ```
   verify_build_and_run.bat
   ```

3. To run the application with specific options:
   ```
   run.bat [options]
   ```

4. For detailed information on using and testing the application, refer to the `PHARMACY_APP_GUIDE.md` and `README_TESTING.md` documents.

## Conclusion

The scripts and documentation created provide a comprehensive solution for testing the Pharmacy Application and interacting with its pages and features. They address the requirements specified in the issue description and provide additional tools for verifying the application's functionality.
